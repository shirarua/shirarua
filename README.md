# Hi there 👋 #

## The Basics

😄 She/Her 🗣️ SHEE-rah 🌶️ Neurospicy 

A former neuropsychology student, turned cook, turned data analyst. Let's just say I took the scenic route.

In a wonderfully unconventional way, I was first introduced to data analysis as a kitchen manager. 
I was lucky to work with a talented programmer who built a custom system of interactive reports based on mountains of data. 
Everything from sales data, to recipe costs, to inventory data was automated. 
My decisions were strongly informed by these tools & reports, in addition to my knowledge of food trends & local culture.
I enjoyed this process of learning & decision-making so much, that I 
frequently worked with other managers in the store to assist them in a deeper understanding of their data.

Now, the once seemingly disjointed skills I picked up over the years are finally fitting together. 
I have been able to combine my love of mathematics, behavioral economics, 
psychology, and communication to produce clear narratives out of simple tables of data.

Currently tumbling down the seemingly infinite rabbithole of data analysis :rabbit::stopwatch::sparkles: 
I'm scared to admit that the learning may never end...
