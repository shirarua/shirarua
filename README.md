# Hi there 👋 #

## The Basics

😄 She/Her 🗣️ SHEE-rah 🌶️ Neurospicy 

A former neuropsychology student, turned cook, turned data analyst. Let's just say I took the scenic route.

In a wonderfully unconventional way, I was first introduced to data analysis as a kitchen manager. 
I was lucky to work with a talented programmer who built a custom system of interactive reports based on mountains of data. 
Everything from sales data, to recipe costs, to inventory data was automated. 
My decisions were strongly informed by these tools & reports, in addition to my knowledge of food trends & local culture.
I enjoyed this process of learning & decision-making so much, that I 
frequently worked with other managers in the store to assist them in a deeper understanding of their data.

Now, the once seemingly disjointed skills I picked up over the years are finally fitting together. 
I have been able to combine my love of mathematics, behavioral economics, 
psychology, and communication to produce clear narratives out of simple tables of data.

## In the works

Currently tumbling down the seemingly infinite rabbithole of data analysis :rabbit::stopwatch::sparkles:

I'm scared to admit that the learning may never end...

**On track to complete the following by the end of the month:**
  - [ ] Practicum100 Data Analyst track from Yandex
  - [ ] DataCamp Data Analyst with Python certicification track
  - [ ] A smattering of additional DataCamp courses on SQL, Excel, & more
  - [ ] Perfecting my gluten-free pancake recipe :pancakes:


🔎  Beginning my hunt for my first role as an analyst.
